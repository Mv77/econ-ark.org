# Metadata Required for Auto Index

This document is for working out a system whereby certain kinds of materials (DemARKs; REMARKs) can be automatically indexed by econ-ark.org using metadata that resides with the material itself.

Desiderata:
1. We should have the same mechanism for DemARK and REMARK material
1. That mechanism should involve:
    * "Required" metadata:
        * Author(s) of the material
        * What else?
    *  NOT required (maybe not even allowed):
        * The name of the material itself (because this should never be different from the filename)
        * The location (DemARK; REMARK; examples)

he name of the material - because that should be identical to the filename
        * Author(s)
